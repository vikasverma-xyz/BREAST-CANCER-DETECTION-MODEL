# Breast Cancer Detection Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Breast Cancer Detection Model developed as part of my internship tasks at InternPe. The model leverages several machine learning libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, keras, and tensorflow to accurately classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- keras
- tensorflow

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras tensorflow
```

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection-model.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd breast-cancer-detection-model
```

Run the model:

```bash
python model.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. You can download the dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory or modify the path in the code accordingly.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a Sequential model in Keras with the following layers:
- Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Output layer with sigmoid activation

The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Results
After training the model, we achieved the following results:
- Accuracy: 98%
- Precision: 97%
- Recall: 96%
